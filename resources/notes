Pytest
------
- PyTest is a python testing framework
- It can run tests in paralllel
- It is open source
- More functionality than unittest

- Pytest will run all files from current directory as well as sub directories.
-


Markers:
- Using markers we can group the test cases
Eg.
@pytest.mark.great
def test_greater():
    num = 100
    assert num >10

Here, great is a marker. We can run only marked test cases.
$ pytest -m great

All the test will be executed who is having marker great

----------------------------------------------
Fixtures:
Fixtures are functions, which will run before each test function to which it is applied. fixtures are used to feed some data to the tests
such as database connections, URLs

Fixtures are functions, which will run before each test function to which it is applied. Fixtures are
 used to feed some data to the tests such as database connections, URLs to test and some sort of input data. Therefore, instead of running the same code for every test, we can attach fixture function to the tests and it will run and return the data to the test before executing each test.
